Path Length to Text Display - String Manipulation Hack

  A workaround that I developed when trying to create custom length strings where the length of the string is controlled by the length of the path it follows -it can allow for dynamic text reveals using animated paths, and is based on path length using `String Pad`  converter as a substring function.

  The Setup

  ViewModel Structure

  Create a ViewModel with these properties:
  - pathLength (Number) - stores pixel length of the path (pushed from the path's `Length` property)

  - charWidth (Number) - an average width of the character using your font
  - displayString (String) - leave empty 
  Create the following converters:

  The Trick

  String Pad converter on an empty string acts like substring:
  - Input: "" (empty)
  - Pad Text: Your actual string
  - Length: How many characters to show

  This pulls the first N characters from your text!

  Step-by-Step

  1. Bind Path Length

  Select your path → Length property → Bind to pathLength

  2. Calculate Character Count

  On charCount property:
  - Source: pathLength
  - Formula: floor(pathLength / charWidth)

  3. Setup Text Display

  On your Text element:
  - Bind text to displayString
  - Add String Pad converter:
    - Pad Type: Start
    - Text: bind to fullString
    - Length: bind to charCount

  Calibrating Character Width

  Quick method:
  1. Type "MMMMMMMMMM" (10 chars)
  2. Measure width
  3. Divide by 10
  4. Update charWidth

  Common values:
  - Courier 10pt: 6px
  - Consolas 12pt: 7px
  - Roboto Mono 14pt: 8px

  Result

  As your path changes length, the text reveals/hides characters proportionally. Path of 240px with 8px/char = 30 characters shown.

  Use Cases

  - Progress bars - reveal percentage text
  - Data viz - show values as bars grow
  - Loading effects - typewriter reveals
  - Creative typography - path-driven text

  Tips

  - Use monospace fonts for consistent spacing
  - Add min() and max() to constrain output
  - Animate path with Trim Path for smooth reveals
  - Store long strings in ViewModel to avoid retyping

  That's it! A simple hack that opens up creative possibilities for dynamic text in Rive.
