Path Length to Text Display - String Manipulation Hack

  A workaround that I developed when trying to create custom length strings where the length of the string is controlled by the length of the path it follows -it can allow for dynamic text reveals using animated paths, and is based on path length using `String Pad`  converter as a substring function.

**SETUP**

  **ViewModel Structure:**

  Create a ViewModel with these properties:
  - character-width (Number) - an average width of the character using your font
  - string-length (Number) - a number that will hold the number of character to be revealed.
  - blank-string (String) - leave empty 
  
  **Create the following converters:**
  
  Formula - {Input}/{{vm/character-width(px)}} 
  Pad String - add the string you want to reveal, then data bind `Length` property of the converter to `string-length` view model property, and set `Direction` to `End` value

**Artboard Setup**

- add a text string - and delete the dummy `text` 
- add a path - this will be the path your string will follow (its fun to add the bones to vertices so that it is easier to control the path)
  
*N.B. this works best with monospace fonts - but will work with any fonts but not as precisely.* 

  Step-by-Step

  1. Convert path length to character count

  Select your path's `Length` property  and bind it to `string-length`, and use the formula converter on it.

  2. Setup Text Display

on

  On your Text element:
  - Bind text to displayString
  - Add String Pad converter:
    - Pad Type: Start
    - Text: bind to fullString
    - Length: bind to charCount

  Calibrating Character Width

  Quick method:
  1. Type "MMMMMMMMMM" (10 chars)
  2. Measure width
  3. Divide by 10
  4. Update charWidth

  Common values:
  - Courier 10pt: 6px
  - Consolas 12pt: 7px
  - Roboto Mono 14pt: 8px

  Result

  As your path changes length, the text reveals/hides characters proportionally. Path of 240px with 8px/char = 30 characters shown.

  Use Cases

  - Progress bars - reveal percentage text
  - Data viz - show values as bars grow
  - Loading effects - typewriter reveals
  - Creative typography - path-driven text

  Tips

  - Use monospace fonts for consistent spacing
  - Add min() and max() to constrain output
  - Animate path with Trim Path for smooth reveals
  - Store long strings in ViewModel to avoid retyping

  That's it! A simple hack that opens up creative possibilities for dynamic text in Rive.
