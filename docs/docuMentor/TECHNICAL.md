# Technical Documentation

I'll analyze the docuMentor codebase and create comprehensive technical documentation. Let me start by examining the project structure and key components.Now let me examine the key source files to understand the architecture and components:Now let me examine more components to understand the data structures and algorithms:Now let me create the comprehensive technical documentation:Technical documentation created at `/Users/ivg/github/docuMentor/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`. The document covers:

- **System Architecture**: Layered architecture diagram and principles
- **Key Components**: DocumentationAgent, FullMontyGeneratorV3, Claude integration, safety systems, UI components
- **Data Structures**: Project analysis, configuration, tag management, and reporting structures  
- **Algorithms & Patterns**: Command, Observer, Strategy, Singleton patterns; tag similarity, project detection, lock management algorithms
- **Performance**: Streaming processing, async I/O, memory management, caching strategies
- **Security**: Path validation, sensitive data detection, backup strategy, process isolation
- **Testing Approach**: Unit, integration, performance, security testing strategies with 80% coverage target
