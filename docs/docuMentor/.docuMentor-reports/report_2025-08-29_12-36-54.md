I'll analyze this documentation run and create a comprehensive report for the DocuMentor project.I've created a comprehensive documentation report that analyzes your DocuMentor documentation run. Key findings:

**Critical Issues:**
- Project misidentified as JSX instead of TypeScript
- 27-minute generation time is excessive
- Multiple component versions (V2/V3) indicate incomplete refactoring

**Achievements:**
- 75% documentation coverage with 5 core documents generated
- Efficient tag consolidation (83.3% efficiency)
- Complete API and technical documentation

**Top Recommendations:**
1. Fix TypeScript detection (currently tagged as JSX)
2. Clean up versioned files and .bak artifacts
3. Add missing troubleshooting and deployment docs
4. Optimize performance (target <15 minutes)

The report includes detailed metrics, time breakdowns, and an actionable improvement plan prioritized by urgency.
