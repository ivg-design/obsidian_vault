I need more information to generate documentation. Could you please provide:

1. What specifically should I document? (e.g., a codebase, API, specific files, or the docuMentor project itself)
2. Any source files or content I should analyze to create the documentation

For example:
- Should I document the entire docuMentor project?
- Should I focus on specific components like the TUI, CLI commands, or the efficient architecture?
- Or do you have specific files you'd like documented?
