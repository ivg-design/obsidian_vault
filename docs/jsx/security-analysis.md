I'll perform a comprehensive security analysis on the `/Users/ivg/github/jsx` directory. Let me start by understanding the project structure and then systematically analyze each security aspect.## Security Analysis Complete

I've completed a comprehensive security analysis of `/Users/ivg/github/jsx`. Here's the summary:

### Critical Findings:

1. **Code Injection (eval) - CRITICAL** üî¥
   - Multiple dangerous `eval()` usages with user input
   - `/packages/ae-scripts/src/composition/Guiderator.jsx:56` - Direct eval of user input
   - `/packages/cep-extensions/frame-navigator/src/jsx/index.jsx:152` - Expression evaluation

2. **Hardcoded Credentials - MODERATE** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Password 'changeme' in `/packages/cep-extensions/frame-navigator/cep.config.ts:53`
   - Sensitive config in .env.example

3. **No Security Framework** ‚ùå
   - No authentication/authorization (N/A for desktop app)
   - No CSRF protection
   - No security headers
   - Limited input validation

### Key Recommendations:

**Immediate:**
- Replace ALL eval() usage with safe alternatives
- Remove hardcoded credentials
- Implement input validation/sanitization

**Medium Priority:**
- Run dependency audit (`yarn install` then `yarn audit`)
- Add security logging
- Create security guidelines

**Overall Security Score: 3/10** - Critical improvements needed, especially the eval() vulnerabilities which allow arbitrary code execution.
