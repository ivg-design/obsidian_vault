# JSX - Adobe After Effects Automation Suite

## Project Purpose and Goals

The JSX project is a comprehensive collection of production-ready automation tools for Adobe After Effects, designed to streamline motion graphics workflows and enhance productivity. It serves as a monorepo containing:

- **31+ standalone ExtendScript (.jsx) automation scripts**
- **Modern CEP extensions** with React-based UI
- **Native AEGP plugins** for deeper After Effects integration
- **Shared utility libraries** for consistent functionality

The primary goal is to provide motion designers and animators with powerful tools that eliminate repetitive tasks, enable complex rigging systems, and improve workflow efficiency in After Effects.

## Key Features and Functionality

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Capabilities

1. **Animation & Rigging**
   - Advanced IK limb rigging system with curvature control
   - Path-following animations with easing and loop controls
   - Property linking with driver-based interpolation

2. **Composition Management**
   - Guide creation with calculation support
   - Preset compositions for various aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16)
   - Split-screen templates for mobile formats

3. **Visual Effects**
   - Color interpolation across properties
   - Centralized audio control system (Voice/SFX/Music)
   - Audio-to-visual property synchronization
   - Animated stroke burst effects

4. **Keyframe Manipulation**
   - Batch keyframe value modification with math operations
   - Temporal decay and easing duplication
   - Current value recording as keyframes

5. **Layer Management**
   - Text highlighting with animators
   - Advanced multi-parent systems
   - Parametric to bezier path conversion
   - Time remapping controls

6. **Path & Shape Tools**
   - Dynamic vertex control via nulls
   - Layer distribution along paths
   - Shape path origin centering
   - Mask to shape layer conversion

### ðŸŒŸ Flagship Tools

- **Rectangulator v2** - Iconic parametric rectangle to bezier converter
- **Frame Navigator** - Modern CEP extension for timeline navigation
- **Parametric IK Limb** - Complete character rigging system
- **sfxMaster** - Professional audio management suite
