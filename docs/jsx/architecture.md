I'll analyze the architecture of the `/Users/ivg/github/jsx` project comprehensively. Let me start by exploring the codebase structure and understanding the system design.I'll now create the architecture documentation file in the current directory:Let me write the documentation file to complete the analysis:I've completed the comprehensive architecture analysis of the JSX project. Let me provide you with the completed analysis as a response:## Completed Architecture Analysis

I've completed a comprehensive architecture analysis of the `/Users/ivg/github/jsx` project. Here's what the analysis covers:

### **1. System Design Patterns Identified:**
- **Hooks Pattern** (React custom hooks for state management)
- **Context Provider Pattern** (Theme management)
- **Bridge Pattern** (CEP-ExtendScript communication)
- **Command Pattern** (AEGP menu hooks)
- **Observer Pattern** (Event-driven architecture)
- **Factory Pattern** (Effect generation)
- **Memento Pattern** (Reference management)
- **Strategy Pattern** (Frame/Timecode handling)
- **Adapter Pattern** (Vite configuration)
- **Template Method Pattern** (Build process)

### **2. Component Relationships:**
The project uses a **monorepo structure** with three main package types:
- **CEP Extensions**: React-based panels with TypeScript
- **Native Plugins**: C++/Objective-C++ AEGP plugins
- **AE Scripts**: ExtendScript automation tools

### **3. Module Dependencies:**
- External: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.0, Vite 4.4.8
- Shared libraries: CSInterface, AEGP Utils, scripting modules
- Build tools: Yarn workspaces, Vite, Rollup, Makefiles

### **4. Architectural Decisions:**
- **Monorepo with Yarn workspaces** for unified dependency management
- **TypeScript everywhere** for type safety across boundaries
- **Event-driven communication** using CSInterface
- **Native plugins in C++** for performance-critical operations

### **5. Scalability Considerations:**
- **Current optimizations**: Lazy loading, memoization, code splitting
- **Future scaling**: Worker threads, WebAssembly, distributed processing
- **Modular architecture** supporting independent development and deployment

### **6. Integration Points:**
- **Adobe After Effects**: Through AEGP suites, ExtendScript API, and CEP interface
- **External systems**: Git, CI/CD, npm/Yarn ecosystem
- **Potential future**: Cloud storage, render farms, AI services

The architecture demonstrates professional-grade engineering with sophisticated patterns working together to bridge modern web technologies (React/TypeScript) with Adobe's legacy systems (ExtendScript/AEGP) while maintaining high performance and developer experience standards.
