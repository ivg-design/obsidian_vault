I'll analyze the test suite in the /Users/ivg/github/jsx directory comprehensively. Let me start by exploring the repository structure and understanding the testing setup.Now let me explore the package structure and identify test files:Let me search for test files throughout the repository:Let me look for test files specific to this project:Now let me check the tools/aegp-test-framework which appears to be the primary test framework:Let me analyze the test framework files:Now let me check the actual test files in the framework:Let me check what JavaScript test files might exist in the packages:Let me check if there's any Jest or other test configuration:Let me check if there's any test coverage configuration and run the existing test framework:The test framework has a compilation issue. Let me check for other scripts or testing mechanisms:Let me look at the actual JavaScript source files to understand what should be tested:Now let me check the actual scripting modules that need testing:Let me check the documentation to understand the testing approach better:Let me examine the actual test files in the framework to assess quality:Now let me check if there are any test execution scripts for JavaScript modules:Now let me generate the comprehensive test analysis report:## Test Analysis Report Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the test suite in `/Users/ivg/github/jsx`. Here are the key findings:

### Critical Findings:
- **0% JavaScript/TypeScript test coverage** - No JS tests exist
- **AEGP C Framework** present but has compilation errors
- **No test infrastructure** for JavaScript modules
- **Overall Test Maturity Score: 1.5/10**

### Main Issues Identified:
1. **No JavaScript Testing**: Despite having 13+ JS modules in scripting-modules and multiple CEP extensions, there are zero JavaScript tests
2. **AEGP Framework Broken**: The C-based test framework has a linker error (`_AEGP_GenerateMainReport` undefined)
3. **No CI/CD**: No automated testing or coverage reporting
4. **Missing Test Documentation**: No JS testing guidelines or conventions

### Immediate Recommendations:
1. Fix AEGP framework compilation issue
2. Setup Jest for JavaScript testing
3. Create initial test suite for critical modules (Ae.js, RefManager.js)
4. Implement basic CI pipeline with GitHub Actions

The repository urgently needs a JavaScript testing infrastructure to ensure code reliability and maintainability. Would you like me to create the test analysis report file or help implement the testing infrastructure?
