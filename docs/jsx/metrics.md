I'll analyze the codebase in /Users/ivg/github/jsx and generate comprehensive code metrics. Let me start by exploring the repository structure and gathering the necessary data.Now let me gather comprehensive metrics for this codebase:Let me use proper shell commands:Let me use the Glob tool to find files properly:Now let me gather more specific metrics using proper analysis tools:Let me use a different approach:Let me create a comprehensive metrics analysis script:Now let me run a more comprehensive analysis:Now let me create the final comprehensive metrics dashboard:## âœ… Code Metrics Analysis Complete
