## Planned Features

### Stream-JSON Implementation

- **Benefits**: Real-time streaming, 1-3s first token latency
- **Details**: See [[STREAM_JSON_IMPLEMENTATION]]

## Current State

### Working Implementation
- **Python Provider** (`claude_cli_provider.py`) running on port 19385
- Successfully bridges Claude Code CLI to Raycast AI
- Uses shell helper script for CLI execution
- Cleans Claude Code SDK artifacts from responses

### Not Working
- TypeScript Raycast extension commands (experimental)
- CCProxy integration (abandoned)
- LiteLLM configuration (not used)

## 2024-08-23 - Initial Development

### Created
- Multiple experimental TypeScript files for Raycast extension
- Python provider implementation
- Shell helper scripts
- Test infrastructure (unused)

### Issues
- TypeScript extension approach didn't work
- Switched to Python provider approach
- Many experimental files left in repository

## Notes

Previous documentation incorrectly stated the project was 70% complete with working TypeScript modules. In reality, only the Python provider is functional.
